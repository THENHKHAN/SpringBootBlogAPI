# Udemy Spring Boot Learning
Welcome to the **Spring Boot Learning With SpringBootBlogAPI** repository! In this project, we explore various aspects of the `Spring Boot` Java framework through a series of mini-projects and exercises. Each branch(used earlier before moving into this repo) represents a specific feature or concept implemented in Spring Boot, ranging from basic CRUD operations to advanced security and validation mechanisms. <br>
